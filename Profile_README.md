Hi, I'm Alexandre, a dev student and to be full stack developer.
I'm currently focusing on more basic languages and starting from scrath with more of a self taught way of learning.
I'm a I.T. Technician at the moment.

Nothing much to see here right now, but I'll be sure to add more info as I improve.
